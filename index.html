    <a> About me</a>
<ul>

<li>
    I am from Turkiye!
</li>

<li>
    I learned HTML and CSS in 1-2 weeks approximately. There was a point in my learning 
    where I was about to give up because I forgot a lot. But now, I am way better than I expected.
    If you are learning coding/programming, never lose hope! I believe in you!
</li>

<li> 
    I am a front-end developer, I have advanced level of HTML & CSS knowledge. I am also learning Javascript,
    hoping to get better in Javascript soon.
</li>

<li> If you have mutual interests as me (my interests are on my discord about me), don't be afraid to 
    text me! A few new friends would be nice. Also, ping me whenever you want, text me as much as you want,
    I don't bite.
</li>

<li> 
    I speak Turkish and English both on a fluent level, but I can understand Azerbaijani too except I cannot write in Azerbaijani much. I know a few words though.
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="extra">
<a> Extra </a>

<p> I don't code for people, I code for fun, but if you have a silly website idea (no advanced javascript pls)...
    Then reach out to me on discord lol I have a whole document for silly website ideas. BUT no guarantees.

<p> All courses above are free and on youtube and they were very efficient for me, so i recommend them if you
    plan on learning.  Good luck!!
